This repository contains a collection of Java programs designed to help beginners and intermediate learners understand and practice Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). The focus is primarily on solving common DSA problems and implementing array operations, sorting algorithms, and basic logic-based questions, which are frequently asked in coding interviews and technical assessments.

🔍 What's Included?
This project includes a variety of Java files that perform essential DSA operations such as:

Basic Array Manipulation

AddingArray.java – Add elements to an array and display them

ReverseArray.java – Reverse the elements of an array

CountEvenAndOdd.java – Count even and odd numbers in an array

DuplicateElement.java – Identify duplicate elements

Element Finding

maxElement.java – Find the maximum element in an array

minElement.java – Find the minimum element in an array

SecondLargest.java – Find the second largest element

SingleNumberFinder.java – Find the element that appears only once

Sorting Algorithms

AsendingElement.java – Sort the array in ascending order

DecendingOrde.java – Sort the array in descending order

More sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort can be added

Mathematical and Logical Operations

AverageElement.java – Calculate the average of array elements

ReverseElement.java – Reverse individual elements or a string

OOP Example

Student.java – Basic implementation of an object-oriented class
